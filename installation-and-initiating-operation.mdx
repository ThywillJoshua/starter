## 4.1 Appropriate operating site

<callout>
  The Hand Washing Station shall not be used outdoors and must be protected
  against moisture, heat (ambient temperature > 40 °C), oily, sun and corrosive
  environment. Install the Hand Washing Station so that it is protected from
  direct sunlight and in an environment that is not too brightly enlightened.
  Use the hand wash system in a normal environment without significant vibration
  or dust and, in particular, without flammable gases or combustible evaporating
  liquids. For connection and environmental conditions please refer to chapter 9
  Technical data.
</callout>
## 4.2 Offloading Avoid any shock and damage to the Hand Washing Station. The Countertop
model is provided in one box. The Wall-mounted and Free-standing models are provided
in three boxes each. In their packaging the Hand Washing Station model Countertop
has a weight of approx. 20 kg, the model Wall-mounted approx. 36 kg and the model
Free-standing approx. 40 kg. Carrying and offloading should be carried out by 2 persons.
After arrival of the system check all components for damage from transport. In case
of any transport damages please immediately notify your service partner or Smixin
SA ## 4.3 Qualification of installation and commissioning personnel
<callout>
  The Hand Washing Station is connected to the clear fresh water and the
  drainage network. In addition a power connection is necessary. Installation,
  Commissioning and repair work may therefore only be carried out by qualified
  personnel!
</callout>

<accordion title="4.4 Installation of Countertop Hand Washing Station">
The Countertop Hand Washing Station is supplied with a positioning jig and 6 screws for installation on a counter. The supplied screws (5 x 45 mm) are dimensioned for counters with a thickness between 5 and 30 mm. If your counter measures more than 30 mm, the screws should be longer by the difference between 30 mm and the actual counter thickness.

<callout type="warning">
  **Damage of the sink due to long screws** If you use other than the supplied
  screws, make sure that they are not too long. Oversized screws damage the sink
  of the Hand Washing Station.
