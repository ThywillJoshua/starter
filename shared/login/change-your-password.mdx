There is one way to reset your password in Pulse.

**Changing your password**

1. Click on your name on the top right corner
2. Click on **Profile**
3. Scroll down to the end of the page and click on the **Edit** button close to the Password line
4. Type your old password and your desired new password and click **Save**

**Note:** The password must consist of at least 8 characters, including a lowercase letter, a capital letter and a special character (e.g. ?, %, /). Any password with 12+ characters is also valid.

If you log in to Pulse with your company login, you can not change your password in Pulse.
