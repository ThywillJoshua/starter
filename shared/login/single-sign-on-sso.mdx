Single Sign-on (SSO) lets users access Pulse with their existing company credentials. After authenticating once with your identity provider (IdP), Pulse signs you in automatically.

<Callout variant="info" title="What users experience">
  - Start at `https://COMPANYNAME.start-pulse.com`  
  - Redirect to your company IdP (e.g., Azure AD, Okta)  
  - Return to Pulse already authenticated
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if SSO is enabled">
    If your Pulse URL redirects to your company login, SSO is active. Otherwise, you will see the Pulse email/password screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in via your IdP">
    Enter your regular company credentials and complete MFA if required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Land in Pulse">
    You are returned to Pulse without creating a separate password.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Admin setup needed">
  SSO requires configuration with your IdP and may incur an additional charge. Contact Pulse to enable it and provide metadata (entity ID, ACS URLs, certificates) as requested.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="note" title="GIF to capture">
  10–15s clip: open Pulse URL → IdP login → redirected back to Pulse dashboard.
