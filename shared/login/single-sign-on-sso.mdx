Single Sign-on (SSO) means that users only have to log in once at their workplace with their company login. They then have access to all services for which they are authorised. SSO automatically handles the log in for services such as Pulse Feedback in the background.

**Note:** Single Sign-on can be set up quickly and easily on most standard login systems if desired. Note that there is a charge for using SSO. Please [contact](https://www.start-pulse.com/kontakt) our team for more information.
