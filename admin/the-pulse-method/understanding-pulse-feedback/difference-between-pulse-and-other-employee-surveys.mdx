Pulse is a new method that focuses on continuous learning and improvement. Using a bottom-up approach, Pulse establishes a constructive feedback culture and facilitates the identification and removal of barriers – in real-time.

Pulse was originally developed at Swisscom, out of a real need: The results of the employee survey used so far were not actionable, and tangible improvements were difficult to implement. Pulse is now being used successfully by many companies.
