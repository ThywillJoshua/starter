With traditional surveys (many questions, not regular, completely anonymous) it is difficult to implement effective improvements, because the barriers for different places and people are often different. With Pulse, relevant feedback is sent directly to where it has the most impact, namely to the teams. This allows barriers to be identified and removed directly within the team. The transparency of the results throughout the company means that problems that go beyond the team framework can also be identified and tackled together.
