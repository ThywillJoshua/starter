At Pulse, all employees have access to the results or feedback from their colleagues. All employees (and not just management) work with the results, discuss improvement measures within the team and can thus improve their cooperation and shape their working environment on their own responsibility.

In contrast to classical employee surveys, participants see the results directly after completing the survey and not only when all results are available. This means they can work directly with the results. In this way, changes are supported by everyone and can be implemented sustainably.
