Pulse is a survey tool with which your employees can use open feedback to improve their collaboration and shape their working environment, thereby establishing a constructive feedback culture and inscribing continuous learning and improvement into your organizational DNA. With Pulse, employees are regularly asked about various aspects of their work situation. Thanks to the transparency of the results, employees can identify improvement potential in their teams and the company. This enables them to initiate and implement improvements.

Pulse is developed and provided to you by Creaholic in Biel. Your company's Pulse team is responsible for conducting the surveys.
