With traditional employee surveys (many questions, infrequent, completely anonymous), it is challenging to implement useful improvements because the obstacles that are encountered in the daily work often differ from team to team. With Pulse, relevant feedback is sent directly to where it has the most impact: the teams. This allows barriers to be identified and removed directly within the team. Thanks to the transparency of the results, problems that are faced by many teams can be identified and tackled together.
