Usually, all employees of the company (or sub-department that uses Pulse) take part in the survey. Some companies exclude interns, employees on temporary contracts, or external employees. Contact your company's Pulse team to get more information.

If you have just started in your company, your start date must be before the first day of the survey. You must also have a company email address to participate.
