Your own working environment consists of all the people you work with on a regular basis. Depending on your role in the company, this can be mostly your team but also many different people from different areas. The decisive factor here is the lived reality and not the hierarchical position in the organisation. Depending on the situation, the working environment also includes factors such as the workplace, systems and processes or cultural aspects that have an influence on your work.
