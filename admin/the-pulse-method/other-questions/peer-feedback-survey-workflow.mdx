The process is different for feedback seekers and feedback givers.

**Feedback seeker**

1. **Reflect:** think about what you would like to receive feedback on from your peers.
2. **Set up a survey and invite feedback givers:** choose from our templates, or start with a blank survey. Adjust the selection of questions if necessary, and add your desired feedback providers.
3. **View results:** once your peers have completed the survey, the most important phase of Pulse begins. You can look at their feedback and use our results' analysis guide to get the most out of the feedback you received.
4. **Discuss results:** if questions arise, or you feel the need to talk, arrange an exchange with your peers. Discuss with your peers what is going well and what you can improve. Use our feedback discussion guides for this.
5. **Implement improvements:** Set goals to improve and work steadily on them until the next peer feedback round.

**Feedback giver**

1. **Give feedback:** as soon as you’re asked to give feedback, you’ll receive an invitation by e-mail. Use the link to access the survey and give your open and constructive feedback to your peer.

2. **Confirmation by e-mail:** after completing the survey, you’ll receive your answers by e-mail. This allows you to refresh your memory at a later stage if your peer would like to have a feedback conversation with you.
2. **Feedback session:** if the feedback seeker has any questions, he/she may invite you to a feedback session. To prepare, you can look at your answers again.
