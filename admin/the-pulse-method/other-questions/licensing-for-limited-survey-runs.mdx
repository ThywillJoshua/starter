In contrast to classic surveys, with Pulse, everyone in the company works with the results. To have access to Pulse at any time (to view and work with the results), you need a running Pulse license for the whole year. In principle, it is possible to cancel the license contract and sign it again later in the year. However, this will require some effort for the administration and for setting up or closing the account.

<Callout variant="info" title="License expectation">
  Pulse is designed for year-round access so teams can view and act on results anytime.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Pausing a license">
  Stopping and restarting mid-year is possible but creates admin overhead and setup/close effort. Plan for an annual term if you need ongoing access to results.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="note" title="GIF to capture">
  None needed; licensing guidance.
