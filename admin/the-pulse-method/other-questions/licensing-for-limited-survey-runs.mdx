In contrast to classic surveys, with Pulse, everyone in the company works with the results. To have access to Pulse at any time (to view and work with the results), you need a running Pulse license for the whole year. In principle, it is possible to cancel the license contract and sign it again later in the year. However, this will require some effort for the administration and for setting up or closing the account.
