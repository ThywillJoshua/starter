Yes, Pulse can also be used if your company is not classically organised but works in an agile setup (e.g. Holacracy). In Pulse, organisations can be mapped very flexibly and this ensures that the lived reality is reflected. With the function of user-defined teams, additional teams can be created and existing teams can be adapted at any time. This is useful for project teams or Scrum teams, for example.

[Here](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/team-feedback/custom-teams/how-can-i-create-or-edit-a-custom-team) you will learn how to create user-defined teams.
