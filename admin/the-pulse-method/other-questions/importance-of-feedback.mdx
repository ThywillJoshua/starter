Feedback is a central component of continuous learning and improvement.

**Mutual feedback makes it easier to do a good job** because, with regular exchange, employees can better understand how their actions and cooperation are perceived by their team of colleagues. Open feedback creates trust because it provides clear pointers and orientation. This confidence is the basis for effective cooperation and team performance.

**Feedback leads to reflection.** Giving feedback and receiving feedback leads to reflection on one's own behaviour and that of others. This reflection is the basis for learning and change.

**Feedback helps to discover new opportunities** for development on a personal level and leads to an investment in one's own abilities.

**Feedback enables a flexible adaptation to a constantly changing environment.** With continuous learning of strengths and collective improvement opportunities, the organisation as a whole continues to develop.

**Feedback leads to food for thought and new ideas from other perspectives**. Feedback is, therefore, a basis for innovation. It helps to make decisions that are more broadly based.
