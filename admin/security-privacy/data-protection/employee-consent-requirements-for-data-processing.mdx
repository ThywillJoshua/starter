We process the personal data of your employees only on your behalf and in accordance with our contract and are therefore contract data processors. As a data controller, you are responsible for ensuring that we are allowed to process your employees' data and must obtain their consent in advance.

You can find more information on how we process the data in our terms and conditions, [here](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/security-privacy) or at team@start-pulse.com.
