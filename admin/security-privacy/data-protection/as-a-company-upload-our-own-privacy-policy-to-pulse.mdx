We offer a standard software with Pulse. Therefore, it is unfortunately not possible for you to upload your own internal documents to Pulse.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Custom privacy policies not supported">
  The app doesn’t host your internal privacy policy. Share your policy via your intranet or HR systems instead.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info" title="What you can do">
  Reference your policy in onboarding communications and add links in your own email templates if needed.
</Callout>
