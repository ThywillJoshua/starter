All data and entries that are transmitted to us during registration, account access and use are encrypted according to the latest security standards. The same applies to all participant and survey data.

Encrypted databases and backups protect your data from unauthorized access and data loss. We use encryption when sensitive information or data needs to be sent - both for internal communication and when contacting you.
