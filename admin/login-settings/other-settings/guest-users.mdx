It’s possible to invite guests as well as employees. In this way, external persons such as consultants or internal persons who do not participate in the survey due to their function can be given access to Pulse. Guests cannot take part in the surveys but can view the results.

  - External consultants who need to review results  
  - Leaders who do not participate but must read outcomes  
  - Auditors who need temporary read access
