Admins have full access to Pulse. They can manage participants and surveys and view the results. They can also participate in surveys if they are on the participant list.

<Callout variant="info" title="What admins can do">
  - Create, edit, and launch surveys  
  - Import/edit participants, teams, managers  
  - Configure email templates and reminders  
  - Moderate comments and manage visibility rules  
  - View results; participant data remains anonymous unless the survey is configured otherwise
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Keep admin list small">
  Limit admin roles to trusted owners. Review the admin roster regularly and remove access when people leave the program.
