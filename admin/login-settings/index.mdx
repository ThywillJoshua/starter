## Set up a secure login baseline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm the company URL">
    Pulse access starts from `https://COMPANYNAME.start-pulse.com`. Share this in onboardings so users skip search errors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose SSO or password">
    If SSO is available, users will be redirected to your identity provider. Otherwise, they use email + password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enforce password hygiene">
    Remind password users about length/complexity rules and how to change their password inside Profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define admin/guest policy">
    Keep a short list of admins with clear ownership and grant guest access only when needed for specific surveys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor assignments">
    Periodically review team/manager mappings to avoid visibility errors and survey misrouting.
  </Step>
</Steps>
