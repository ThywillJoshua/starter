## Recommended flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan the cadence">
    Confirm whether this is a one-off run or a recurring team/peer feedback cycle. Align survey window, reminder timing, and results sharing expectations with stakeholders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare the audience">
    Import participants, ensure teams/managers are correct, and restrict segments if needed. Use a small pilot group to validate content before a full roll-out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize questions and translations">
    Add any custom questions or topics, then confirm translation requirements. Double-check visibility rules on sensitive questions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize invitations and reminders">
    Adapt subject lines, preview text, and CTA copy. Localize the templates and set reminder cadence to match the survey window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch and monitor">
    Send the initial invitation, track participation rates, and moderate any flagged comments. Extend the window if response rates are low.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share results responsibly">
    Ensure availability rules are met before releasing results. Provide managers with guidance on reading scores and discussing comments.
  </Step>
