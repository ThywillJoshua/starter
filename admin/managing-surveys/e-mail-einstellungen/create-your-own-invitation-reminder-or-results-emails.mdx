Yes, that's possible. You have to send the emails with an email program or a mailing tool. You can download the list of participants in the tool (an Excel export of the invitation links for the respective survey).

If [SSO](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/login-settings/what-is-single-sign-on-sso) is activated for your Pulse account, you can simply send the Pulse link (usually \[company\].start-pulse.com) to the participants. If SSO is not activated, all participants who have not yet logged in need a personal invitation link, which you can find in the Excel file mentioned above.

<Callout variant="info" title="When to send your own emails">
  Use custom emails when you want tailored branding or channels outside Pulse’s built-in templates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export links">
    Download the participant list from Pulse (Excel export). It includes personal invitation links per survey.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the link type">
    - If SSO is enabled: use the generic Pulse link (`https://COMPANY.start-pulse.com`).  
    - If SSO is not enabled: include each participant’s personal invitation link from the export.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send via your tool">
    Use your email or marketing tool to send invitations, reminders, or results notifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Avoid link mix-ups">
  Keep personal links matched to the right participant if SSO is off. Mismatching can expose results or break login.

<Callout variant="note" title="GIF to capture">
  Clip: export links → view Excel → note generic vs. personal links for SSO vs. non-SSO.
