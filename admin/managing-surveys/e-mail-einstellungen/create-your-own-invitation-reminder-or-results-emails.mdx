Yes, that's possible. You have to send the emails with an email program or a mailing tool. You can download the list of participants in the tool (an Excel export of the invitation links for the respective survey).

If [SSO](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/login-settings/what-is-single-sign-on-sso) is activated for your Pulse account, you can simply send the Pulse link (usually \[company\].start-pulse.com) to the participants. If SSO is not activated, all participants who have not yet logged in need a personal invitation link, which you can find in the Excel file mentioned above.
