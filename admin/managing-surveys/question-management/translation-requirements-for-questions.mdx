<Callout variant="info" title="Supported languages">
  The Pulse questionnaire ships in German, French, Italian, and English. Custom questions must be translated into the languages you plan to serve.

<Steps>
  <Step title="List required languages">
    Confirm which languages are enabled for your tenant.

    When creating or editing a question, supply text for each language to avoid fallback to the base language.

  <Step title="Review before launch">
    Preview the survey in each language to ensure nothing shows in the wrong language.
  </Step>
</Steps>
