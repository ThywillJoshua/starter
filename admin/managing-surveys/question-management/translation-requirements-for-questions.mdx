Pulse is currently available in German, French, Italian and English. The Pulse questionnaire is available in these languages. If you want to add your [own questions](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/managing-surveys/can-i-add-my-own-questions) to the survey, you will need to translate them into all your desired languages.

**Note:** We will be happy to assist you with the creation and translation of questions as part of an accompanying mandate.
