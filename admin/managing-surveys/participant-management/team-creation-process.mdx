Teams consist of all participants with the same team name. At the beginning of the survey, you will see an overview of your teams and their members.

Supervisors are not part of the team(s) of employees under their control if they are assigned to a different team.

In the example, Anna is in Team Sales and is therefore not part of the Support team.

**Assigning participants to teams has two benefits:**

1. The results can be shown for each team (in addition to the overall results).
2. The comments are shown with name and photo only to team members and in an anonymous form to everyone else.

You can also create a hierarchy of teams. This allows you to represent your company’s hierarchy in Pulse. To do this, list all the teams the participant belongs to. Start with the highest hierarchy level and separate the teams with “>” (e.g., Sales > Agents > Region West > Team Lausanne).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create teams">
    Admin → **Teams** → **Add Teams**. Name the team and mark if it has a parent (superordinate) team.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build hierarchy (optional)">
    List teams from highest to lowest separated by **>** (e.g., Sales > Agents > Region West > Team Lausanne).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign participants">
    Add people to the teams; supervisors belong to their own team and not automatically to subordinate teams.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout variant="info" title="Multiple teams">
  A participant can belong to more than one team. Separate entries with **&&** in imports.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Visibility rules">
  Comments show name/photo to team members; others see them anonymized. Keep assignments accurate before releasing results.
