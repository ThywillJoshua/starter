As an admin, you can easily edit participant information directly in the tool.

**Editing a participant**

1. Click on your name at your top right corner and go to **Admin**
2. In the participant’s table, you can either hover over one participant and click on the pencil icon that appears on the right side over the participant’s language or check the participant box and click on the **pencil icon** ( ✏️) that now appears at the top of the table
3. Make the changes in the respective fields and click on **Save**

**Note:** To perform bulk actions, just select multiple users and click on the pencil icon that appears at the top of the table.
