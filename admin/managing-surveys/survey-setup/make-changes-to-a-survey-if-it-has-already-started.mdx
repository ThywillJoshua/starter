After the survey has started, you have the following options:

- **There are no responses yet**: You can change the start date and delete the survey.

Tip: To make further changes (e.g. add a question) you can change the start date to the next day. Then you can make the desired changes and reset the start date back to today.

- **Responses already exist**: End date of the survey and pending emails can be adjusted.
