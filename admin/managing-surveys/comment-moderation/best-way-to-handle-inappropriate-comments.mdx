Our experience shows that the participants deal with the survey very conscientiously and give a lot of constructive feedback. Inappropriate comments (e.g. with denunciatory or offensive content) are extremely rare.

If a comment is reported, the following procedure can be followed:

1. [Navigate to the comment.](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/managing-surveys/how-can-i-moderate-reported-comments)
2. Look at the contents of the message. Often it is not an offensive comment, but a correction of the comment.
3. Contact the comment writer/reporter if necessary and try to find an amicable solution.
4. Delete/adjust the comment. The comment reporter and the comment writer are automatically informed about the adjustment.
