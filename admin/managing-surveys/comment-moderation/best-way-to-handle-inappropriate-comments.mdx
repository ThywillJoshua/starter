Our experience shows that the participants deal with the survey very conscientiously and give a lot of constructive feedback. Inappropriate comments (e.g. with denunciatory or offensive content) are extremely rare.

<Callout variant="info" title="Principles">
  Respond quickly, be transparent about actions, and preserve constructive intent whenever possible.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the report">
    Open the reported comment (<a href="/admin/managing-surveys/comment-moderation/moderate-reported-comments">steps here</a>). Many reports are clarifications rather than abuses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assess severity">
    Determine if the content is offensive, off-topic, or simply needs context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reach out if needed">
    Contact the commenter or reporter to align on the issue and possible edits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit or remove">
    Adjust or delete the comment if necessary. The commenter and reporter are automatically notified of the change.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Escalations">
  For severe or repeated offenses, document the case and follow your company’s code-of-conduct process.
