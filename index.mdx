## How this site is organized

- **Help tab only** – everything Pulse shared lives in one tab so it feels like an embedded help center inside ClaraDocs.
- **Consistent components** – all articles use Mintlify callouts, cards, and typography so that embedded views feel native to your app.
- **Search-first** – every page includes metadata and clear titles, which powers in-app search and contextual “?” tooltips.

## Looking for something specific?

Use the search bar in the navigation or type `Cmd/Ctrl + K` anywhere in the docs to jump directly to an article. Each category page groups common journeys (like setting up surveys or moderating comments) so you can browse when you’re not sure what to search for.
