As a rule, all the employees within a company can participate. Some companies exclude interns, employees with fixed-term contracts or external employees. Contact the company's Pulse team for more information.

If you’ve just started working at the company, your first working-day must be before the survey’s first day. Additionally, you must have a company e-mail address to participate.
