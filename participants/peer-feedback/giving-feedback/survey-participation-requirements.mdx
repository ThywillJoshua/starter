Participation in surveys — answering and commenting on questions — is usually optional. Employees who don't participate shouldn't be disadvantaged in any way.

<Callout variant="info" title="Participation stance">
  Peer Feedback is typically voluntary; non-participation should not lead to disadvantage.

  More participation improves the quality of feedback and outcomes for the feedback seeker.
