Participants will receive an e-mail with a link that’ll take them directly to the survey. A few days before the survey ends, a reminder e-mail is sent out to all the participants who haven’t yet responded. Additionally, participants can also directly log into Pulse. All the open surveys are displayed in the main dashboard.
