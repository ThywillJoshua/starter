A rating must be given for each question. Participants can voluntarily add a comment while answering the question to further refine the rating.

**How to view comments:**

1. On the "Results" page, and you'll see an overview of the results. Then, click on the question you're interested in to see the comments.
2. If you scroll down, you'll see the comments for every question.
3. To access the next question — and its comments — click on the arrow in the upper-right corner (next to the question).
