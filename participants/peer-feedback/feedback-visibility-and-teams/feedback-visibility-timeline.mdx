Feedback seekers (the peson who sends out a peer feedback survey) will see your feedback immediately after you submit it.

**Notes:**

With peer feedback, only feedback seekers see the results.

The rating will only be visible to feedback seekers. They can see which category - Improve (1 to 6), Neutral ( 7 & 8), Continue (8 & 9) - a response belongs to by filtering the comments by category.
