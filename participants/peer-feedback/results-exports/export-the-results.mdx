Exporting your results is effortless. After you’ve completed the survey, you can export them at any time.

**Exporting the survey’s results**

1. Make sure you’re on the Results page (check this by clicking on your name in the top-right corner). Look for the **Work with the results** link, right under your name in the top-right corner, and click on it.
2. A pop-up menu will open, click on **download feedback discussion guide**, and download the **results' analysis guide**. These two documents already contain the results and will help you analyse and discuss the results with your colleagues.

**Note:** you can export the survey’s results at any time and as often as you want.
