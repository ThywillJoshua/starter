This is how you can compare surveys over time with Peer Feedback:

1. Click on the corresponding survey in the **Dashboard** to get to its results
2. Slide the **Toggle-Button** for the time comparison to the right. This is located on the right above the score bars
3. You can now directly compare the scores over time
