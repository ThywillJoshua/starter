The rating for each question is assigned to one of three possible categories: Improve (1 to 6), Neutral (7 & 8) and Keep it up (9 & 10).

**The score is calculated as follows**

The percentage of participants in the group "Keep it up" less the percentage of participants in the group "Improve" (scores are presented without "%"). The lowest possible score is -100, the highest possible +100.
