The rating for each question is assigned to one of three possible categories: Improve (1 to 6), Neutral (7 & 8) and Keep it up (9 & 10).

**The score is calculated as follows**

The percentage of participants in the group "Keep it up" less the percentage of participants in the group "Improve" (scores are presented without "%"). The lowest possible score is -100, the highest possible +100.

<Callout variant="info" title="Formula">
  Score = % Keep it up (9–10) − % Improve (1–6). Range: -100 to +100. Neutral (7–8) counts as 0.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bucket responses">
    1–6 = Improve, 7–8 = Neutral, 9–10 = Keep it up.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Subtract">
