These aspects will help you to make the outcome discussion with your peers a success.

**Warm-up phase**

A warm-up phase should create a comfortable atmosphere so that your peer can tune in and get involved in the results discussion, thus creating space for open feedback. This can be done, for example, through a check-in round where each person tells how they are doing and what is on their mind.

**Feedback round**

At the end of the results meeting, people should reflect on what went well in the conversation and where there is room for improvement. These insights can be compiled together or everyone reflects for themselves and you say afterwards how you experienced the conversation.

**Download the guide for feedback conversations in the Pulse Tool!**

1. Go to the results page. Click on the link **Work with the results** in the top right corner.
2. A pop-up menu will open, click on **Download Feedback Conversation Guide**, and **Download Results Analysis and Reflection Guide**. These two documents already contain all the results and will support you in analysing and discussing the feedback with your colleagues.
