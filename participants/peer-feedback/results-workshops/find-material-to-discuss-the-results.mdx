1. Make sure you’re on your Results page (you can check and click on your name in the top-right corner). Look for the **Work with the results** link, right under your name in the top-right corner, and click on it.
2. A pop-up menu will open, click on **download feedback discussion guide**, and **download results analysis guide**. These two documents already contain the results and will help you to analyse and discuss the results with your colleagues.
