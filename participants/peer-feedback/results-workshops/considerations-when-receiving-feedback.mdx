The same situation can be perceived very differently by different people. With feedback, you get to know other perspectives and get a differentiated picture of the situation.

To recognise this differentiated picture of the situation, here are a few points to help you to process the feedback:

- **Feedback is a perception** and a personal view of the feedback giver.
- **Listening and receiving feedback.** Do not defend your behaviour, but take the feedback with you and reflect on it later.
- **Consider feedback as a gift** and decide for yourself what you want to implement and what you don't want to implement.
- **Ask and understand.** Do not make assumptions because there is a risk that they are simply not true.
