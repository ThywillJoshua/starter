The same situation can be perceived very differently by different people. With feedback, you get to know other perspectives and arrive at a more differentiated picture of a situation.

The following points should be considered when giving feedback:

- **Give specific and observable examples.** If you are too general, it may be difficult for the receiver of your feedback to understand what specific behaviours you are referring to.
- Send **I-messages** and describe your own view. I-messages convey that one's own perception is subjective and give the other person the option of accepting or not accepting the criticism. I-messages do not attack the other person.
- **Be honest** and say what you think. Only honest feedback promotes positive development.
- **Describe feelings** and explain what concrete situations have triggered in you. Colleagues can more easily understand how you feel and can comprehend your behaviour.
- **Formulate wishes** and describe needs so that team colleagues can hear what is important to you and where you want to go.
