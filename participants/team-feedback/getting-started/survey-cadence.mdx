Pulse Feedback has no fixed frequency—it depends entirely on how your organisation uses the tool. Typically, organisations run one to three company-wide surveys per year, each with 5 to 8 questions.

To learn more about how Pulse Feedback is used in your organisation, contact your company's Pulse Feedback team.
