Usually, you will be invited to the survey via email. This email contains the link to the survey.

If you have already logged in once or if your organisation has set up a [SSO connection](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/login-settings/login/what-is-single-sign-on-sso), you do not need a specific link for each survey. Simply log in to Pulse Feedback, and you will see both current and past surveys.

The link to your organisation’s Pulse Feedback instance typically looks like this:

```
https://COMPANYNAME.start-pulse.com
```

This link is often shared through other channels as well (e.g., intranet page, announcement email).

If you are logging in for the first time and your organisation has not set up an SSO connection, you will need to set a password. This usually happens via the survey link in the invitation email.

If you can’t find the email, you can set a password when logging in by entering your email address and selecting **Set new password**.
