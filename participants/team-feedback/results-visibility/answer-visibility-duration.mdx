The data from the surveys is stored as long as your company uses Pulse. This guarantees you the possibility to compare the answers to different questions with those of previous surveys. However, your company may impose a time limit (e.g., anonymise all the comments after 18 months).

  Survey data stays available while your company uses Pulse so you can compare across surveys.
