For each question, you can view the ratings’ distribution in addition to the three score categories ( **Improve**, **Neutral**, **Keep it up**).

How to view the rating distribution:

1. Click on a question or its score bar to get to the detailed view.
2. Click on **Show distribution** below the score bar.
3. Click on **Show Categories** again if you wish only to see the distribution of the categories.

### Rules for showing the rating distribution

To avoid that the ratings of individual participants can be inferred from the distribution, they are only shown if in the following situations:

- if for a given category, there are no ratings;
- if for a given category, there are ratings on at least two different scale points, with at least two ratings each (e.g., two people gave a rating of 3 and, two people gave a rating of 5);
- if for a given category, there are three separate ratings (e.g., 2, 3, 5)
