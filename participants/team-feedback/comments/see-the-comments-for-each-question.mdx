A rating must be given for each question. Participants can voluntarily add a comment while answering the question to further explain the ratings.

**How do you view comments:**

1. On the "Results" page, you'll see an overview of the results. Then, click on the question (" **Show details**") of the comments you're interested in.
2. Now, if you scroll down, you'll see the comments of a single question.
3. Click on the arrow in the upper-right corner (next to the question) to go to the next question or its comments.
