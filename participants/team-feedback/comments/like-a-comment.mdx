Liking comments is a quick way to show your agreement with a topic mentioned in your colleagues’ comments.

**Liking a comment**

1. Click on the **Like icon** located at the bottom of each comment.

**Note:** For likes, the same rules apply as for comments. Your teammates can see you've liked a specific comment; everyone else sees your likes anonymously.
