Exporting your results is easy. After completing the survey, you can export the results at any time.

**Exporting the survey results**

1. Make sure you're on the Results screen (click on your name in the top-right corner to check), find the link **Work with results** below your name in the top-right corner and click on it.
2. A pop-up menu will open, click on **Export as PDF**.
3. Now, choose to export the current page (the results from your current page) or all the results (overview and details of the selected teams, and surveys — max. 50 comments per question).

**Note:** You can export your survey's results at any given time and as many times you wish.
