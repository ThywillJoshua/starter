No, non-anonymous exports aren't available in the system. The security and privacy of your data are essential to us. We, therefore, treat your data with the highest data protection standards. For this reason, we also protect the privacy of our users and don't provide non-anonymous export data as Excel. You can find more information about security and privacy on our [website](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/security-privacy) or you can contact us at team@start-pulse.com.
