The same situation can be perceived very differently by different people. Thanks to feedback, you get to know other perspectives and get a differentiated image of the situation.

To recognise this differentiated image of the situation, here are a few points to help you to process the feedback:

- **Feedback is a perception** and a personal view of the feedback giver.
- **Listening to and receiving feedback** Don't defend your behaviour, but take the feedback with you and reflect on it later.
- **Consider feedback as a gift** and decide for yourself what you want to implement and what you don't want to implement.
- **Ask and understand** Don't make assumptions because there's a risk that they're simply not true.
