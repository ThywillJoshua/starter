These aspects will help you to successfully lead the discussion about the results with your team.

**Warm-up phase:**

The warm-up phase is intended to create a pleasant atmosphere so that participants get in the mood for the discussion about the results and find engagement, thus creating an environment for open feedback.

This is achievable, for example, thanks to a check-in session in which each person shares how they're feeling and what's on their minds. An alternative is to form buzz groups. This involves creating small groups around topics or issues that are discussed in a more personal way.

**Meeting principles:**

At the beginning of the meeting, it's important to define principles that'll be respected throughout the meeting. They expose the desired behaviour for the joint meeting (e.g., active listening, raising hands if principles aren't adhered to).

**Feedback round:**

At the end of the results meeting, it's essential to reflect on what went well during the meeting and assess where there's room for improvement. These insights can be gathered as a group or through a check-out session, in which everyone reflects on the meeting's experience and shares how they experienced it.
