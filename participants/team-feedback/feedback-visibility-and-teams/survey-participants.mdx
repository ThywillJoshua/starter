Surveys can be conducted at the company, department, or team level, as well as with individual participants. Participants are listed at the start of each survey.

_Good to know_: Some companies exclude interns, employees on temporary contracts, and external employees. New employees who joined the company after the survey began are usually excluded as well. Contact your company's Pulse team for additional information.
