It depends.

If you have been invited to participate in the survey, you need to give feedback to see the results while the survey is active. As soon as the survey is finished, you can see the results even if you haven't participated.

If you are a survey manager or guest but not a survey participant, you can access the results at any time.

<Callout variant="info" title="Access rules">
  - Invited participants: must submit feedback to see results while the survey is active; after it ends, results become visible even if you didn’t participate.  
  - Survey managers/guests: can access results anytime.
