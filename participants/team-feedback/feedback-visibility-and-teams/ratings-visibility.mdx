Only you can see your ratings on the scale from 1 to 10. To everyone else who has access to the survey (participants, survey managers and guests), your ratings are only visible in the form of total scores per question. [Learn more about who can see your feedback](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/team-feedback/feedback-visibility-and-teams/who-can-see-my-feedback).

Your team members can see which category – _Improve_ (1 to 6), _Neutral_ (7 & 8), _Keep it up_ (9 & 10) – your answers belong to when they [filter comments by categories](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/team-feedback/comments/how-can-i-filter-the-comments). However, this is only possible if you’ve posted a comment on that question.
