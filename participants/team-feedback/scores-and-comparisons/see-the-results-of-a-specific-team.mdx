After you've submitted your answers, you'll see the results for all the participants. You can also simply view the results of one or more teams.

**How to show the results of one or more teams:**

1. Click on **Results of** \[your company\] on the Results page (under the title) or scroll down to "Compare teams" and click on it.
2. Click on the team(s) for which you'd like to view their results. The desired teams will appear under "Selected teams."
3. Click on "Apply."
