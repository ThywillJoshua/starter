Pulse Feedback surveys are usually conducted several times a year and the results of older surveys are saved and can still be viewed. You can therefore compare the results of the different surveys to follow the development in your company.

1. Click on the corresponding survey in the **Dashboard** to get to its results
2. Slide the **Toggle-Button** for the time comparison to the right. This is located on the right above the score bars
3. You can now directly compare the scores over time

**Note**: If your team has been renamed and you no longer see the history of your last polls, you can restore the history by creating a [group](https://www.start-pulse.com/en/resources/help/team-feedback/how-can-i-create-or-edit-a-custom-team).

To do this, create a group based on the old and the new OU name and give it an easily understandable name (e.g. \[NEW TEAM NAME\]-History). You now have an overview of all past data.
