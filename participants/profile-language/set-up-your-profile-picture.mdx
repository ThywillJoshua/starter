Your profile photo helps your team know who you are in Pulse. And, if your picture is clear, it'll be easier for someone to find your comments when scanning the survey results.

**Setting your profile picture**

1. Click on your name on the top right corner
2. Click on **Profile**
3. Tap the profile picture box and upload a photo from your Gallery
4. After uploading your picture, you can resize or click **Save**

**Note:** Your profile photo will only be visible to the people who can see your feedback.
